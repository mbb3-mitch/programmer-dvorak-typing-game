Let no one ever come to you without leaving better and happier. Be the living expression of God's kindness; kindness in your face, kindness in your eyes, kindness in your smile, kindness in your warm greeting.","words":["Spread","love","everywhere","you","go:","first","of","all","in","your","own","house.","Give","love","to","your","children,","to","your","wife","or","husband,","to","a","next","door","neighbor.","Let","no","one","ever","come","to","you","without","leaving","better","and","happier.","Be","the","living","expression","of","God's","kindness;","kindness","in","your","face,","kindness","in","your","eyes,","kindness","in","your","smile,","kindness","in","your","warm","greeting."]}
